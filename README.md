#HELLO THIS IS THE README

I trained a small deep neural network on some text data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/ubuntu-dialogue-corpus?select=toc.csv

The neural network will take in some words and it will try and predict a word as a response. This model can then be used to take an input from a human and output a response
based on how the training data worked with it. I utilize flask and html to try and link it to a webpage, but unfortunately the webpage isn't done yet.
